So, we've given people something to believe in. Something they can feel
that they are a part of, that they can struggle for, and that they can
win at.

What are the kinds of problems that we need to solve?

* Climate change is a real thing. As areas appropriate for particular
  crops shift to different areas, crops and/or people will need to
  shift, which will result in conflict and war. This is happening
  already. Dimagi has projects in some of these places. Climate change
  will also result in disastrous hurricanes, storms and floods. Also
  happening already. All of this will continue to get worse.

* Apart from a few very scary moments, in particular a truly terrifying
  `moment in 1962`_, nuclear weapons have been safeguarded by just two
  groups of adults. That is no longer true. Today the largest arsenal
  is controlled by a megalomaniacal tyrant who is currently invading
  Europe, and soon the second-largest arsenal will be controlled by an
  easily flattered, narcissistic man-baby. China is rapidly approaching
  from behind, with India, Pakistan and Israel also in the race, and
  new entrant North Korea, headed by a guy who executed his uncle,
  along with his uncle's children and grandchildren, just to be
  thorough. These are not the people I would want controlling weapons
  that could cause the kind of nuclear winter that would kill off
  everyone except a handful of tech billionaires sheltering in bunkers
  in New Zealand.

  The more civilization-ending bombs that humanity is juggling, the more
  likely it becomes that we'll drop one. And if they are controlled by
  people who are thinking about using them, and we know they're
  thinking about it because they say so out loud, then the risk just
  escalates.

* In 2001 a small group of people studied how to fly aeroplanes, and
  then successfully managed to fly three out of four into buildings.
  They hoped to trigger a conflict that would bring an end to Western
  society.

  In 2024 it is possible for a small group of people to study how to
  create a variation of smallpox in a lab. Covid had a death rate of
  between 1 and 2% of those infected. Smallpox has a death rate much
  much higher than that, and a synthetic variant could reach upwards of
  90%. If the only survivors were children, they would soon starve.

  As a metaphor for a world in which it is increasingly easy to wipe out
  humanity, imagine an American high school where Second Amendment
  activists have ensured that every teenager has a gun. How would one
  solve the problem of school shootings? One solution is obvious: Every
  other country has done a better job than America at preventing
  teenagers from acquiring guns. But for the sake of our metaphor let's
  take that off the table, and think about another solution: Imagine
  if *none* of the kids want to commit mass murder. Not a single one.

  As it becomes easier to kill everyone---literally everyone---we will
  need to figure out how to identify the people who might, and how to
  help them not to. And I chose those words deliberately. We cannot
  punish people for crimes we think they might commit. We have to help
  them, so that they don't want to.

* Things used to be uncomplicated for men. Right from Day 1, a baby boy
  was a little bit cooler than a baby girl. Parents loved their
  daughters, of course, but dads played catch in the yard with their
  sons. Took them to football matches. Introduced them to their
  business connections, and taught them how to shake hands like a man.
  Moms would divide up household chores in such a way that girls did
  the inside chores, and boys did the outside chores, and the outside
  chores never took as much time as the inside chores. Sometimes
  transgressions were dismissed with "boys will be boys," or a wink
  behind Mom's back.

  Boys grew up with a certain understanding of how things were, and
  certain expectations of how things will be for them.

  Except, now there are girls who have the same expectations.

  And it comes as a rude surprise for men that their expectations aren't
  specially for them. The things that previously were only available to
  men, like the best-paying jobs, or the legal right to make all of the
  decisions, now those things are available to everyone.

  So men can no longer trade on them. Women used to need men, and that
  is no longer true.

  Some men understand that the way to get laid, and to have happy,
  successful relationships, is not to trade access to money for those
  things, but rather to be the kind of person that other people want to
  sleep with, and want to have happy, successful relationships with.

  Other men don't understand this. A surprising number of them,
  actually. Being a decent human being is complicated. They want their
  expectations back. They want to go back to the "good old days". They
  want to Make Men Great Again.

  All of us have to help men, starting when they are boys, to be the
  kind of people that other people want to sleep with, and want to have
  happy, successful relationships with, for no other reason than the
  kind of person that they are. Otherwise our society will tear itself
  in two.

There are other problems, but we'll leave it at that.

I want to be clear about what is not a real problem:

* When I was at school, some people didn't fit neatly into the Barbie or
  the GI Joe boxes. We had names for those people. "Tom boy" was one of
  the nicer ones. Today people who don't fit neatly look around, and
  don't see as much vitriol permeating the air about people like
  themselves, and so they aren't as scared of talking about themselves
  to other people. But now that more of them are feeling safe enough to
  talk, safe enough even to live in a way that more accurately
  represents themselves, it is taking the Barbies and the G.I. Joes by
  surprise, and the Barbies and the G.I. Joes are losing their minds.

  This is not the problem that they imagine it is. The people who don't
  fit have always been here. The job of the Barbies and the G.I. Joes
  is to listen. If they listen attentively enough, they might
  understand: Society is not falling apart. It is healing.

So, let's say we have a story, and we can inspire a sense of purpose.

How do we channel that momentum for good? How do we use it to address
our problems?

We need to listen. We need to hear about the big problems like climate
change, and the millions of little problems, like how our kids are
feeling, and how we are all feeling about the challenges that we all
face.

Designing under the mango tree is all about listening directly to the
people who can tell us what the problems are.

How do we do that?
