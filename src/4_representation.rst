Representation
--------------

This is the part that I enjoy. This is the Mango Tree part. And the
Slack-CommCare Connect part.

Areas have representatives. Interests are parties.

No representative should ever work with more than 140 people. So if they
work in a lower and a higher location group, then location groups can
have from 35 to 70 people, so that two 70-person groups add up to 140
people.


Who makes the rules for whom?

I live in Scotland. It's a country. It has its own parliament, and it
levies its own taxes. But also, it's not an independent country. It's
not allowed to join the EU, even though the majority of Scottish people
want to, and it's not allowed to establish its own currency.

So there is a discussion to be had over how much autonomy each level of
representatives should have. I don't have answers, but our system will
need to have those conversations, and figure it out.
