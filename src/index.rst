I've been thinking a lot recently about our problems. In the past I
thought about how to fix democracy, or adopt a better economic
system -- in a completely amateur, uneducated kind of way, to be clear.

But last week something happened that made me sad, and angry. And I
wondered whether I needed to take one more step back. I think we have a
deeper problem, and that's why we can't solve any of the other
problems.
