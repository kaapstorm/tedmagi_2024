I've been thinking a lot recently about our problems. In the past I
thought about how to fix democracy, or adopt a better economic
system -- in a completely amateur, uneducated kind of way, to be clear.

But at the start of November something happened that made me sad, and
angry. And I wondered whether I needed to take one more step back. I
think we have a deeper problem, and it's getting in the way of solving
any of the other problems.
