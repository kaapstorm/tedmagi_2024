There have been times when people have come together, struggled through
incredible hardship, and made tremendous personal sacrifices, in order
to achieve a staggering outcome.

I want to pick as an example all the nations that fought in World War
II, but I want to look at 1947 to 1952. `In Germany`_ after the war, the Allies,
including Russia, were brutal to the Germans. German civilians suffered
1.5 to 2 million deaths. But then in 1947 the
West implemented the Marshall Plan, and built Germany back up. This was
not unrelated to the threat of Communism. The equivalent of hundreds of
billions of today's dollars were loaned to and invested in Germany. The
West provided a market for German products and services. Germany
reestablished its own currency. They formed a new democratic
government. Unemployment decreased. Production increased. The standard
of living increased.

A similar process of reconstruction happened `in Japan`_. Massive
political and economic reforms resulted in the dismantling of ancient
social stratification, allowing economic mobility, and the
liberalization of society, including things like women getting the
vote. Again, a new threat, the war in Korea, provided a market for
goods and services from Japan, and helped to rebuild the economy.

Was everything peachy? Absolutely not. Some terrible things happened and
I want to acknowledge that I am skipping over those things. But the
good things are that recent enemies, who had committed atrocities
against each other, came together, and built something better than what
had existed before. Some would argue, better than what had existed in
the countries of both the vanquished and the victors!

World War II, Communism, and the Korean War, gave people something to
overcome, and to struggle for. It united them with a common purpose.

Recently `in Edinburgh`_, people pushed rocket fireworks through the
mail slots in the front doors of random strangers. They threw bottles,
bricks and fireworks at police ... because ... it's fun.

We all know what happened recently in America: A rapist and convicted
felon, who tried to overturn the results of the previous election, won
this election. One reason is the same reason that teenagers throw
bottles, bricks and fireworks at police:

People need to feel part of a team. They need something that they want
to work together for, struggle for, something difficult, sometimes
dangerous, that they can feel they can win at.

They need to be the heroes of their own `hero narrative`_.

Hero narratives give people a sense of purpose.

A purpose carried by a powerful story.
