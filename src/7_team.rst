We have already covered that, just as it is illegal for company officers
to lie to shareholders, that, obviously, should also be illegal for
government officials and representatives to lie to the electorate.

But that isn't good enough. The electorate should, as much as possible,
be lie-proof. Education is an investment in the capital of society, and
that includes knowing how we know things. It's difficult, I know, but
as best as possible, we should know how we know things. And if we can
get that right, ideas like vaccines causing autism, or Q-Anon, will
just never be able to take off.
