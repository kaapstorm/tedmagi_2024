When you have parallel media universes, and social media stops deleting
or tagging lies, you can invent a comprehensive fake universe, with
wildly distorted enemies, and present yourselves as the struggling
underdog good guys.

But legislating against misleading the electorate is not good enough.
People should, as much as possible, be lie-proof. Education is an
investment in the capital of society, and that includes:

* being media literate
* giving weight to expertise
* while still not completely trusting authority
* understanding how we know things
* understanding the purpose of free speech and only amplifying
  information that fulfills that purpose.

It's difficult, I know, but as best as possible, everyone
should know how to evaluate information. And if we can get that right,
then ideas like vaccines causing autism, or Q-Anon, will never be able
to get off the ground.

The members of the Republic of Humanity are the foundation of the
success of everything. Governance must no longer be a top-down project
of how many voters a politician can persuade. It must be a bottom-up
project of how do we identify problems, find solutions, resource them,
and execute on them.

We have some really big problems. Maybe something like an app, designed
for better governance, can help us to solve them.
