This is the impact part. To an audience like Dimagi, this bit is
obvious.

A lot of work needs to be done in the world. With greater technological
risks, we need to hear and to help every person. Even simpler than
counseling and mentoring, just providing friendship and community can
turn society into a healthier, happier, more responsible, more
accountable place to exist. ... But counseling and mentoring too.

Climate change results in people moving because they have to. Homes and
buildings and businesses need to be built. Damaged property needs to be
rebuilt. Land needs to be reallocated and rehabilitated.

Governments create their own problems: There is a lot of disgruntlement
and anger felt by people who have been sidelined, or forgotten, or
systemically disadvantaged, by governments.

That gets fixed in different ways:

* Being part of the government through representation

* Equitable allocation of funding for a comprehensive suite of services
  that together provide economic opportunities. So not just education,
  but transport and electricity too. Many Western countries do a
  terrible job at this, where communities remain economically
  disadvantaged, generation after generation.

* Being part of the solution. The Irish in the 19th century in America
  were a social underclass until many of them took roles in the
  services that the government paid for. But, again, the government
  needs to step up. Roles like nurses, teachers, and cops, must be paid
  a wage that is commensurate with the contributions that they make to
  society. These jobs should not just be a calling. They should be
  rewarded.

The Republic of Humanity has an opportunity to execute on solutions to
intractable problems in our societies. But there is on *sine qua non*;
one thing without which everything will fail.
