The Story

The goal here is to come up with a better system: A system for solving
problems. And if one of the problems we're trying to solve is being
able to identify things that we don't know are true, then establishing
that system by creating a sense of purposed based on a bullshit story,
is a fundamental structural flaw, and the system can only be successful
up to the point at which it dismantles itself. So that's not going to
work.

The story needs a *tangible* threat. The threat of Communism was pivotal
in the successful rebuilding of Germany. The war in Korea was
instrumental in the reconstruction of Japan. "Illegals" who
are "invading our country" and "eating the dogs", are a tangible
threat, even though it is wildly distorted.

"Climate change" is just not tangible. The threat needs to conjure the
face of a human antagonist in people's minds. How about the oil
corporation executive, and the coal mine shareholder, and the PR
consultant? They have all been lying to us so that they can keep on
grifting as long as possible, because it is *our* children who will go
hungry, and fight and die in avoidable wars, not them or theirs.

How do we fight them?

We make it a crime to lie to the electorate. If we are to make
informed choices, if we are to consent to the actions of our rulers, we
must know what is true. When Enron lied in their financial reporting,
shareholders sued them for $40,000,000,000. It's against the law to lie
to shareholders. But it's not against the law to lie to voters. *That
is insane.* It must change immediately.

And what about the plutocrats: the billionaire friends of politicians
(and supreme court justices); the tech bros who have governments at
their mercy; and the heirs who inherited real estate empires from their
dads? Tax cuts for the rich mean reduced social services that will
cripple the working class (sometimes literally) and eviscerate the
middle class. All stable democracies rely on a middle class that is
influential enough to hold their leaders to account. We all know
countries where the leadership is not held to account. They all have a
weak middle class.

How do we fight the plutocrats?

The solution is a difficult one to accept: We all have to pay 39% on
both income and capital gains. Everyone, we all pay the same percent,
so that rich people don't get to claim that they are supporting the
country. Everyone is supporting the country at the same rate. 39% gives
the government a big lever to manage inflation, while it spends on
social services and investments. And then everyone gets those social
services. Rich and poor. Everyone gets to go to school. Everyone gets
enough transport to get to school or to work. Everyone gets enough
electricity to cook with and to study by. Everyone gets medical care.
You don't need medical insurance if the medical care is good. When rich
people get services that benefit them too, then they don't feel like
their taxes are some kind of charity. When social services offer poor
people the opportunities that they need to get ahead, then they can
also afford 39% tax.

There is one other benefit: When everyone has the opportunities that
they need to succeed, not just the lucky ones, then historical
inequities can be resolved.

(To be clear, this doesn't solve racism. In fact, racists need an
underclass in order to feel better about themselves, just as
misogynists do, and steps towards economic equality can trigger a
backlash. But racism and sexism become easier to deal with when
everyone has the financial means to rely on themselves.)

Every time the topic of taxes comes up, the plutocrats threaten to
leave. But that is not a problem!

    Norway also came up with the idea of the state owning shares in
    private companies: after the second world war the government
    nationalised all German business interests in Norway and ended up
    owning 44% of Norsk Hydroâ€™s shares. The formula of controlling
    business through shares rather than regulation seemed to work
    well ...

    -- `The Economist`_

Countries don't need plutocrats. The governments of market-based
economies can invest money in companies themselves.

Oh dear. That got nerdy very fast, and nerdy economics doesn't work in a
story. Let's try that again.

How do we fight the plutocrats?

We all pay more tax. We all get the services we need, to give us all a
chance to succeed like they did. If they refuse to pay the same tax
rate as all of us, we will arrest them. If they run away, we will
replace their money.

That sounds a little snappier.

It is important to recognize that these two-dimensional cut-out
"baddies" will be associated with real people who deserve care just as
much as anyone else. And these people need an obvious path to
redemption, and support to help them to get there. They also need to be
the heroes of their own narratives. And maybe we need to give them a
story to spell it out for them: A way in which their families can be
supported while they transition to paying their fair share of tax, or
shift from lobbying legislators to allow more use of coal and oil, to
lobbying them to invest in battery manufacturers.

Are these stories enough to give people something to struggle for?

To live for?

There is a principle that every religion (`even Satanism`_) holds a
variation of, and that is what is known as `the Platinum Rule`_:
"Treat others how they would like to be treated." When we peel back the
layers of all of the stories, that is what we should find.

We should definitely workshop my stories. I have zero bestsellers under
my belt. I don't imagine that my story is a great one. What stories can
you tell?
