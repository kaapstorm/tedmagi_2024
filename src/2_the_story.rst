The Story

For what I have in mind, this sense of purpose will need to carried by a
true story.

The goal here is to come up with a better system: A system for solving
problems. We can't solve problems if we don't know what is true. If we
can't tell the difference between what we think we know and what we
actually know, then we are guaranteed to get some stuff wrong.

So we want a story, to create a sense of purpose, to motivate people to
solve problems. And if the problem-solving system we want to create
helps us to tell facts from fiction, and we're presenting our story as
fact, it better be a true story.

The story also needs a *tangible* threat. For example, human enemies are
tangible. "Illegals" who are "invading our country" and "eating the
dogs", are a tangible threat, even though that threat is obviously,
wildly distorted.

"Climate change" is just not tangible. The threat needs to conjure the
face of a human antagonist in people's minds. How about the oil
corporation executive, and the coal mine shareholder, and the PR
consultant? They have all been lying to us so that they can keep on
grifting as long as possible, because it is *our* children who will go
hungry, and fight and die in avoidable wars, not them or theirs.

How do we fight them?

We make it a crime to lie to the electorate. If we are to make
informed choices, if we are to consent to the actions of our rulers, we
must know what is true. When Enron lied in their financial reporting,
shareholders sued them for $40,000,000,000. It's against the law to lie
to shareholders. But it's not against the law to lie to voters. *That
is insane.* It must change immediately.

And what about the plutocrats: the billionaire friends of politicians
and supreme court justices; the tech bros who have governments at their
mercy; and the heirs who inherited real estate empires from their dads?
They all campaign for tax cuts for the rich, which mean reduced social
services that will cripple the working class (sometimes literally) and
eviscerate the middle class. All stable democracies rely on a middle
class that is influential enough to hold their leaders to account. We
all know countries where the leadership is not held to account. They
all have a weak middle class.

How do we fight the plutocrats?

We all pay a flat rate of tax that is probably higher than we pay at the
moment. That way, we all get the services we need, to give us all a
chance to succeed like they did. If they refuse to pay the same tax
rate as all of us, we will arrest them. If they run away, we will
replace their money. (More on this later.)

It is important to recognize that these two-dimensional cut-out
"baddies" will be associated with real people who deserve care just as
much as anyone else. And these people need an obvious path to
redemption, and support to help them to get there. They also need to be
the heroes of their own narratives. And maybe we need to give them a
story to spell it out for them: A way in which their families can be
supported while they transition to paying their fair share of tax, or
shift from lobbying legislators to allow more use of coal and oil, to
lobbying them to invest in battery manufacturers.

Are these stories enough to give people something to struggle for?

To live for?

There is a principle that every religion (`even the Satanic Temple`_)
holds a variation of, and that is what is known as `the Platinum Rule`_:
"Treat others how they would like to be treated." When we peel back the
layers of all of the stories, that is what we should find.

We should definitely workshop my stories. I have zero bestsellers under
my belt. I don't imagine that my story is a great one. What stories can
you tell?
