The Story
---------

   Generate an image of a chimpanzee reading to a human baby.

If we are comfortable with lying, all the limits are off. Call me a
libtard, and a skeptic, but I haven't yet given up on telling people
the truth.

But as a skeptic, I acknowledge that I could be wrong about that. More
people identify as Christians than any other religion, but they are
only 31%, less than a third, of all of us. And so every single one of
us has to acknowledge that at least 70% of humanity, possibly more if
you don't identify as a Christian, believe things that aren't true.

That is to say that everyone must recognise, even if you don't think
that what you believe is bullshit, that globally bullshit has been
massively successful, by a very, very wide margin.

So my hope, that we can come up with a reality-based story, might
actually be wildly optimistic. But I think it's worth a try.

Ethical concerns about lying aside, the goal here is to come up with a
better system: A system for solving problems. And if one of the
problems we're trying to solve is bullshit, then establishing that
system by creating a sense of purposed based on a bullshit story, is a
fundamental structural flaw, and the system can only be successful up
to the point at which it dismantles itself. So that's not going to
work.

The story needs a *tangible* threat. The threat of Communism was pivotal
in the successful rebuilding of Germany. The war in Korea was
instrumental in the reconstruction of Japan. "Illegals" who
are "invading our country" and "eating the dogs", are a tangible
threat, even though it is wildly distorted. "Climate change" is just
not tangible. The threat needs to conjure the face of a human
antagonist in people's minds.

How about the oil corporation executive, and the coal mine shareholders,
and the PR and marketing consultants? They have all been lying to us so
that they can keep on grifting as long as possible, because it is our
children who will go hungry, and fight and die in avoidable wars, not
them or theirs.

How do we fight them?

We make it a crime to lie to the electorate. If we are to make
informed choices, if we are to consent to the actions of our rulers, we
must know what is true. When Enron lied in their financial reporting,
shareholders sued them for $40,000,000,000. It's against the law to lie
to shareholders. But it's not against the law to lie to voters. *That
is insane.* It must change immediately.

And what about the plutocrats; the billionaire friends of politicians
(and supreme court justices), the bros who have governments at their
mercy, and the heirs who inherited real estate empires from their dads?
Tax cuts for the rich must be linked with reducing social services that
will hollow out the middle class. All stable democracies rely on a
middle class that is strong enough to hold their leaders to account. We
all know countries where the leadership is not held to account. They
all have a weak middle class.

How do we fight them?

This is a tough one. We all have to pay 39% on both income and capital
gains. Everyone, we all pay the same percent, so that rich people don't
get to claim that they are supporting the country. Everyone is
supporting the country at the same rate. 39% gives the government a big
lever to manage inflation, while it spends on social services and
investments. And then everyone gets those social services. Rich and
poor. Everyone gets to go to school. Everyone gets enough transport to
get to school or to work. Everyone gets enough electricity to cook with
and to study by. Everyone gets medical care. You don't need medical
insurance if the medical care is good. When rich people get services
that benefit them too, then they don't feel like their taxes are some
kind of charity. When social services cover what poor people need, not
only to make a living, but also to get ahead, then they can afford 39%
tax.

There is one other benefit: When everyone has the opportunities that
they need to succeed, not just the lucky ones, then historical
inequities can be resolved.

Every time the topic of taxes comes up, the plutocrats threaten to
leave. But that is not a problem!

    Norway also came up with the idea of the state owning shares in
    private companies: after the second world war the government
    nationalised all German business interests in Norway and ended up
    owning 44% of Norsk Hydroâ€™s shares. The formula of controlling
    business through shares rather than regulation seemed to work
    well ...

    -- `The Economist`_

Countries don't need plutocrats. The governments of market-based
economies can invest money in companies themselves.

Oh dear. That got nerdy very fast, and nerdy economics doesn't work in a
story. Let's try that again.

How do we fight them?

We all pay more tax. We all get the services we need, to give us all a
chance to succeed like they did. If they refuse to pay the same as all
of us, we will arrest them. If they run away, we will replace their
money.

That sounds a little snappier.

Is that enough to give people something to struggle for?

To live for? There is a principle that every religion (`even Satanism`_)
holds a variation of, and that is what is known as `the Platinum Rule`_:
"Treat others how they would like to be treated." When we look behind
all of the stories, that is what we should find.

We can't threaten people with an eternity in hell, or motivate them with
an eternity in heaven. But I hope that with a good story, that won't be necessary.

We should definitely workshop my story. I have zero bestsellers under my
belt. I don't imagine that my story is a great one. What stories can
you tell?
