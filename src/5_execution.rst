A lot of work needs to be done in a world that needs to turn climate
change around, and needs to deal with its consequences. Moving people,
building homes and buildings and businesses, rebuilding damaged
property, reallocating land. It's people who make that happen.

It's also worth pointing out that there is a lot of disgruntlement, and
anger, that they have been sidelined, or forgotten, or systemically
disadvantaged, by the government. That gets fixed by being part of the
government.

To a libertarian that sounds like a hellscape. But it can be done
efficiently. The government doesn't always have to hire people. The way
this often works is that the government hires companies, and those
companies hire people.

Sometimes the government buys small amounts of shares in companies, and
advises them or guides them, like venture capital investors do.
